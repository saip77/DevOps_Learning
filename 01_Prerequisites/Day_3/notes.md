### Day-3 Notes

#### Services, Service Management and Process Control in Linux
- A service is a program that runs in the background and can be started, stopped, and restarted.
- Services are managed by the system using a service manager.

#### What is systemd?
- It is the manager that starts/stops the service when your system boots up or shuts down.

#### What is systemctl?
- It is a command line tool that allows you to control the systemd service manager.
